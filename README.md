“BriseCheck” is a website that scrapes AQI (Air Quality Monitoring) data from India’s official website and presents it in an easy-to-understand format, allowing individuals to make informed decisions about their health and provides a downloadable file with formatted data, empowering the ability to perform analysis on Air Quality Data. India’s website was chosen for this project because air quality is a significant problem in India and the data fluctuates more frequently compared to other countries, thus monitoring such data is more comprehensible. Further, an example of analysis that can be performed using the CSV formatted file is logging all data from file into a database after certain intervals of time and calculating averages of pollution concentration for each day. Then any kind of visualization such as a line chart can be plotted from these averages to track the improvement in reducing the pollution levels.

Listed below are the primary functionalities of this website:

•	Real time AQI data in a concise format of tables.

•	Filters to facilitate data search.

•	Choropleth map and scatter plot for data visualization.

•	Downloadable CSV file for performing data analysis.

•	Engaging game communicating a message to save the trees.
